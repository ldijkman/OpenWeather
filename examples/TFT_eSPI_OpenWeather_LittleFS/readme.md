trying to change the settings from hardcoded to a littlefs file config.txt

electra will do the wifi settings part 

so that you can edit the littlefs config.txt file from ace js inbrowser web cloud editor to configure your openweathermap api key etc.

also could add some fields to wifimanager for openweathermap settings and write it to config.txt

nice add on for electra touch tft https://ldijkman.github.io/randomnerd_esp32_wifi_manager/Touch_Electra-Electra_Touch/

program / install it on your esp8266 from browser

touch Electra

playing with the files at https://github.com/ldijkman/OpenWeather/tree/master/examples/TFT_eSPI_OpenWeather_LittleFS

## changed bmp icons to jpg that saves a lot of littlefs size
- /data littlefs directory something => was 900kb bmp => now 175kb jpg
- do not see any problems with the change to jpg icon images yet
- think its possible to save more littlefs space if images are cropped to content
- but i am happy for now it will fit into Electra
